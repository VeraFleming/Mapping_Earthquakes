# Mapping_Earthquakes

Using a JavaScript and Leaflet we created earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. The next task is earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and data on a third map.

First map we created was Tectonic Plate Map, you can see the pictute of it below.

Next was Major Earthquake Map, you can see below the screenshot of it.
