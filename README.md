# Mapping_Earthquakes

Before, using JavaScript and LeafLet library for interactive maps we created our earthquake map with two different layer maps and the earthquake overlay. 

Now for the Challenge, we need to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and we need to see the data on a third layer map.
